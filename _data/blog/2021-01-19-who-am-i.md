# Hello world!

I am echvzb, well..., actually my name is Eduardo Chavez. First of all, I'm pretty grateful to you for reading this kind of post. I'm highly glad to share with you something more than technical writings and I begin with who I am.

This post is important because it is essential to know who you are reading:

> Tell me who you read and I will tell you who you are. 

You know people are different in the world, we come from different worlds and realities, even in our countries.

I think I need to denote who I am descriptively. However, I will write this post in a general way, as time goes on, I will deeply discuss my thoughts, the opportunities I had and I will have, my experiences and my philosophy.

Let's start with the important things relative to me.

## Content.

1. [Where I come from.](#where-i-come-from)
2. [Philosophy and ideals.](#philosophy-and-ideals)
3. [Technological background: the main thing.](#technological-background-the-main-thing)
4. [What is next?](#whats-next)

<div id='where-i-come'></div>

## Where I come from.

I am 19 years old, I am from Mexico and I live in Puebla city, so my native language is Spanish. I am currently studying an undergraduate degree which is computer science at [Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla](https://www.buap.mx/).

</div>

As mexican, I am a nationalist, this means that I am proud of my country, but not in a patriotic way, I don't believe that the only country that exists is Mexico, _"I don't get tangled up in the flag"_, but I am very proud of my culture.

<div id='ideals'></div>

## Philosophy and ideals.

The most important things for me are ethical values and ethics, my decisions must be based on that. I am not perfect, I have done a number of mistakes, but I always try to consider what I can and cannot do: my limits.

Being consistent, I believe that if you say you are this or that, it must be with responsibility and commitment that what you say is true. I bet this is because of my interests in the exact sciences, nothing should be ambiguous.

One of my beliefs is that to improve our context as a society, we have the obligation to participate and fix our problems, only us, no one more. The context is not only at a national level, but at a personal level as well, nobody will come to change our life, it is not convenient to wait for it, we are the ones who must do it. 

Therefore, in my opinion, we need education, it should not be a privilege of a few, it should be a human right for everyone. It is something very idealistic, I have this commitment to provide education based on my method and truth, it may not be the best, but I want to contribute.

In the past I wanted to be a politician, but once I had a talk with my uncle, understanding that there is another way to achieve it and that way is with technology.

I never feel satisfied with what I do or learn, it is not due to I am very demanding, It is because I always have in mind to achieve the best, the best is perhaps not at a regional level, it is at a global level, there are no borders in this sense, there are no limits to do things.

What I have learned from my family is that commitment not only to do things well, but to do more than what is expected of you, I try to reflect it, I may or may not achieve that, but I am committed to do it.

I am a tough guy, the first one I am tough with is me, I have zero tolerance in my actions and I believe that we must demand every minute to achieve our goals, every minute counts. That is my personality.

## Technological background: the main thing.

This part is the most important thing in this publication, to tell the truth I don't like meritocracy, but it is important to know a little about myself in technology. Each one of the experiences I will publish them later in detail.

First of all everything starts formally in 2019, at the beginning of the year I saw the announcement for the 24th Mexican Olympiad in Informatics - Puebla, therefore I decided to participate.

</div>

I was quite interested, the reason was something silly perhaps, the truth is that I participated as I was very interested in traveling; in some talks with my family, they mentioned that sometimes we do things to achieve other things in life, such as work, and the competition could be the same thing (I was not focused). 

I participated and was part of the selection of my state to represent it nationally in the 24th Olympiad of Informatics, in this competition I learned competitive programming with C / C++ programming language, from February to May of 2019, I was immersed in this competition. Not only I learned to program competitively, it changed my mentality and my world. It opened my eyes.

At the same time I participated in a hackathon in a technological university in my city, it was a video game in Unity, with the C# language, I won the first place. In this journalistic note is such achievement (written in Spanish): 

["Game to learn history, winners of Puebla propose App - e-consulta.com"](http://geeks.e-consulta.com/apps/video-juego-para-aprender-historia-proponen-ganadores-de-puebla-app/).

</div>

I had not programmed in such a way in the past, years ago I had only programmed in Basic and Pascal, but in a very basic way.

Then after not winning a medal at national level I began to prepare myself in my failures. At that time there was another important hackaton in my city, I wanted to participate and I prepared myself for months in C# and I won with a team the second place.

</div>

After that my goal was to specialize in a programming language, so for the rest of the year I was coding with Python. So far as such I was interested in doing personal projects, applications.

At the end of the year I was studying Django, the interesting thing is that I didn't have a solid preparation in the web, so I dedicated myself to prepare me in web programming and I achieved the Javascript full stack in 7 months with 20 completed projects. 

This is my personal portfolio describing my skills: [portfolio.echvzb.me](https://portfolio.echvzb.me)

Indirectly my main programming language became Javascript, as a result I feel very comfortable using it.
