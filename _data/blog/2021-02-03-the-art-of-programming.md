Programming involves in a direct way different features of some disciplinary fields which are mathematics, engineering, and science.

First, a programmer denotes ideas with a language called math “the language of science”. Math is a universal language, it is the same around the world, it does not change, each one of us can understand it.

Galileo Galilei said:

> Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe.

We use math as a language to express quantity, change, structure, and space. Our ideas in programming are related to solving a problem, we build expressions to find exact or approximate answers and solutions.

As a language, we know that in order to express ideas, we need a noun and a predicate.

So, we know nouns are anything that names (objects), in math, we can consider as nouns numbers, shapes, symbols such as infinite and pi, variables, expressions, and much more.

On the other hand, the core of the predicate are verbs, we have a number of symbols that denote actions (verbs). For example, mathematical operations (addition, multiplication), order operators (more than, less than, equals), trigonometric functions, and so on.

The unique language that a programmer interprets is math. Abstraction is our main tool to transition from subjective ideas to math expressions.

Then,

Finally,

We are here to solve problems.

Thanks for reading.
